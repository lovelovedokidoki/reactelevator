## Domain Knowledge

Domain knowledge for elevator control software would be: Safety regulations, norms for elevator operation and maintenance, hardware specifications and protocols for the specific elevator.

## Stack

To make the product of the exercise a little bit more interesting in terms of technologies you wished to see integrated (ReactJS, Webpack, SASS) I decided to interpret it as a user interface for an elevator. My code is a Node.js app setup to run easily with npm. It doesn’t need a database.

### Elevator.js

Usually with these kinds of projects I have actual hardware to program against, so I start out the excercise defining a class, ‘Elevator’ that is very simple and a bit stubborn: It can move up and down, close doors, open doors, and will only do one thing at a time. This class doesn’t handle any of the behaviour expected from the exercise paper.

### ElevatorInterface.js

To do that, I implement a React component called ‘ElevatorInterface’. First I make a skeleton for it, then build a testsuite with tests that necessitate the wanted behaviour. Now, testing in React proved to be a bit difficult. (I have some experience with React, but not many years.)
There’s a few kinks such that rendering is not done the same way and therefore especially setState can act differently in testing than in browser rendering. Because setState will not activate a callback function correctly under testing, I had no way to prevent a race condition that occurs when using state to contain knowledge about which floors have been enqueued by the user. In a production version of such a project as this that would be a no-go, but I’ll let it be since it’s just an exercise. Grill me about it if you would like to. :-)

The ElevatorInterface class requires 2 things for usage: 
* 1. It accepts a prop “arrivedAtFloorEventHandler” that it expects to be a method with signature (x : number) => void. That will be called every time the elevator arrives at a floor requested by a user.
* 2. You request a floor by calling it’s enqueuefloor method passing a floornumber as a parameter. This is automatically mapped to button onClick events in buttons generated by the ElevatorInterface class on render.
* Optional 3. The class accepts a “speed” prop containing a number that will be used by the undelying Elevator class to determine how long it waits before resolving promises. This is used in the testsuite to avoid tests taking decaseconds to complete.

I didn’t put in the extra time to make the app really shiny and pretty, and it only shows the last visited floor number. If you run it, check out the console for hints as to how the elevator moves. I made it verbose.
